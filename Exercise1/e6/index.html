<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
  They had made it to Las Vegas, wide-eyed and with so much hope and energy.
  They had planned the trip for more than a year and both were so excited they
  could barely control themselves. They still hadn't realized that Las Vegas
  promised a place where dreams come true, it was actually the place where
  dreams came to die.

  "Begin today!" That's all the note said. There was no indication from where it
  came or who may have written it. Had it been meant for someone else? Meghan
  looked around the room, but nobody made eye contact back. For a brief moment,
  she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams, but ultimately
  decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away.
